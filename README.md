# About the Project

```
1. I fetched the data of quiz from the API provided. Took help of Youtube videos to set it up as I needed backend for it to work (server.js) to remove CORS error.
```

```
2. Added funtionality to click on option. If right it'll highlight green and if wrong then red.
```

```
3. When anyone selects wrong option, the correct answer automatically gets highlighted in 'Blue'.
```

```
4. At the end of the quiz, the final score is shown out of 10.
```

```
5. Made a simplistic UI with responsiveness and functionalities as asked.
